## **🎯 Project Highlights**

**Example:**

* Built a CNN model using sci-kit learn and TensorFlow to solve racial disparities in dermatology AI by creating a model that accurately classifies skin conditions regardless of skin color.
* Achieved an F1 score of 0.04928  and a ranking of 56 on the final Kaggle Leaderboard
* Used \[explainability tool\] to interpret model decisions ← not sure what to put here 
* Implemented rotating, shifting, and blurring data images to optimize results within computing constraints

## **🏗️ Project Overview**

Equitable AI for Dermatology: This challenge is about making AI better at diagnosing skin conditions for everyone, especially people with darker skin tones. Right now, many dermatology AI tools don’t work as well for these groups because they haven’t been trained on diverse skin images. This can lead to misdiagnoses, delayed treatments, and bigger health disparities.

Our goal is to train a machine-learning model that can accurately classify 21 different skin conditions across all skin tones. Using datasets from Kaggle, our team will work to improve the model’s accuracy.

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**Answer the relevant questions below based on your competition:**

**WiDS challenge:**

1. What brain activity patterns are associated with ADHD; are they different between males and females, and, if so, how?
2. How could your work help contribute to ADHD research and/or clinical care?

**AJL challenge:**

As Dr. Randi mentioned in her challenge overview, “Through poetry, art, and storytelling, you can reach others who might not know enough to understand what’s happening with the machine learning model or data visualizations, but might still be heavily impacted by this kind of work.”
As you answer the questions below, consider using not only text, but also illustrations, annotated visualizations, poetry, or other creative techniques to make your work accessible to a wider audience.

1. What steps did you take to address [model fairness](https://haas.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/What-is-fairness_-EGAL2.pdf)? (e.g., leveraging data augmentation techniques to account for training dataset imbalances; using a validation set to assess model performance across different skin tones)
2. What broader impact could your work have?
