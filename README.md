## **🎯 Project Highlights**

**Example:**

* Built a CNN model using sci-kit learn and TensorFlow to solve racial disparities in dermatology AI by creating a model that accurately classifies skin conditions regardless of skin color.
* Achieved an F1 score of 0.04928  and a ranking of 56 on the final Kaggle Leaderboard
* Used \[explainability tool\] to interpret model decisions ← not sure what to put here 
* Implemented rotating, shifting, and blurring data images to optimize results within computing constraints

## **🏗️ Project Overview**

Equitable AI for Dermatology: This challenge is about making AI better at diagnosing skin conditions for everyone, especially people with darker skin tones. Right now, many dermatology AI tools don’t work as well for these groups because they haven’t been trained on diverse skin images. This can lead to misdiagnoses, delayed treatments, and bigger health disparities.

Our goal is to train a machine-learning model that can accurately classify 21 different skin conditions across all skin tones. Using datasets from Kaggle, our team will work to improve the model’s accuracy.

## **🖼️ Impact Narrative**

**AJL challenge:**
   As a team, we used data augmentation to ensure that our training model had equal amounts of all skin tones. We rotated, shifted, and blurred the data so that our training data had a larger range of skin tones. This allows for our model to be trained on more then one skin tone and be able to identify skin conditional regardless of the shade. Below you will see an example of what blurred data looked like:

   The broader impact of this model would mean that dermatology AI would be more racially inclusive allowing for all people to use it without fear of misclassification or inaccuracy. Overall creating a more inclusive environment for all users.

## **🚀 Next Steps & Future Improvements**

* As a team we experienced difficulties in improving the score of our model, we tried to use CNN but it became quickly apparent that CNN might not work.
* With more time our team would have been able to test more models allowing us to have a range of options on how to execute the model.
* We could have looked for more data to have a larger dataset to train and test on.
