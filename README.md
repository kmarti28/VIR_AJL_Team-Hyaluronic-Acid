# About -- Kennedy 
_Equitable AI for Dermatology:_ This challenge is about making AI better at diagnosing skin conditions for everyone, especially people with darker skin tones. Right now, many dermatology AI tools don’t work as well for these groups because they haven’t been trained on diverse skin images. This can lead to misdiagnoses, delayed treatments, and bigger health disparities.

Our goal is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify 21 different skin conditions across all skin tones. Using datasets from Kaggle, our team will work to improve the model’s accuracy.
