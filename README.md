## **üéØ Project Highlights**


* Utilized machine learning techniques with scikit-learn and TensorFlow to develop an inclusive CNN machine learning model for dermatology that accurately classifies skin conditions across all skin tones.
* Achieved an F1 score of 0.04928  and a ranking of 56 on the final Kaggle Leaderboard. 
* Implemented data preprocessing approaches of rotating, shifting, and blurring data images to optimize results within computing constraints.

## **üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Setup & Execution** 

**Provide step-by-step instructions so someone else can run your code and reproduce your results. Depending on your setup, include:**

* From Kaggle, copy and edit the starter code
* Review current starter code for understanding
* For the initial run, confirm that all imports complete properly and there are no errors
* The Jupyter notebook cells contain all imports necessary for properly running the code, so as long as they are run in order there should be no issues.

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

Equitable AI for Dermatology: This challenge is about making AI better at diagnosing skin conditions for everyone, especially people with darker skin tones. Right now, many dermatology AI tools don‚Äôt work as well for these groups because they haven‚Äôt been trained on diverse skin images. This can lead to misdiagnoses, delayed treatments, and bigger health disparities.

Our goal is to train a machine-learning model that can accurately classify 21 different skin conditions across all skin tones. Using datasets from Kaggle, our team will work to improve the model‚Äôs accuracy.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

* The dataset is a subset of the FitzPatrick17k dataset, a labeled collection of about 17,000 images depicting a variety of serious (e.g., melanoma) and cosmetic (e.g., acne) dermatological conditions with a range of skin tones scored on the FitzPatrick skin tone scale (FST).
* We displayed some of the different datasets and attempted to augment them using shifting, blurring, and rotation
* We noticed that there were large disparities in skin condition and skin types
* there was also the skin type that the experts labeled and self-labels that the users gave these disparities made it difficult to decide which of the features were a more accurate depiction of skin condition
* Additionally there were some examples that had no skin condition label (-1) and in that case we were unsure of what to do in those instances.

* How your model performed overall
* How your model performed across different skin tones (AJL)
* Insights from evaluating model fairness (AJL)

**Potential visualizations to include:**

* Confusion matrix, precision-recall curve, feature importance plot, prediction distribution, outputs from fairness or explainability tools

## **üñºÔ∏è Impact Narrative**

**AJL challenge:**
   As a team, we used data augmentation to ensure that our training model had equal amounts of all skin tones. We rotated, shifted, and blurred the data so that our training data had a larger range of skin tones. This allows for our model to be trained on more then one skin tone and be able to identify skin conditional regardless of the shade. Below you will see an example of what blurred data looked like:

   The broader impact of this model would mean that dermatology AI would be more racially inclusive allowing for all people to use it without fear of misclassification or inaccuracy. Overall, this creates a more inclusive environment for all users.

## **üöÄ Next Steps & Future Improvements**

* As a team we experienced difficulties in improving the score of our model, we tried to use CNN but it became quickly apparent that CNN might not work.
* With more time our team would have been able to test more models allowing us to have a range of options on how to execute the model.
* We could have looked for more data to have a larger dataset to train and test on.
